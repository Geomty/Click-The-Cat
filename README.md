# Click The Cat!
A fun app created with Electron! (Try clicking it 100 times ;D)

If you want to try it yourself, clone the repository (assuming you have git installed). Then open "install.bat" to install the dependancies, you can delete this file once you are done with it (please do not run it more than once!). To play the game, run "start.bat" (this can be run infinite times).
